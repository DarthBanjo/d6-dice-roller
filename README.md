# D6-dice-roller Macro
For [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com), and ideally, [OpenD6 Space](https://gitlab.com/vtt2/opend6-space). But it should be game system agnostic. Easily roll dice with a wild die, keep a history of dice rolled. Copy the contents of the [d6-dice-roller text file](./d6-dice-roller) to a Script-type Macro.
